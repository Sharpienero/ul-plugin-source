# Plugins
These plugins are maintained and actively being developed.

### Current finished list of plugins:

* #### Lumbridge Castle Burn and Hop
    * Start this plugin on the top level of Lumbridge castle between the four log spawn spot. Have a tinderbox in your inventory. The plugin will automatically burn the logs and then proceed to hop to a *normal* world, meaning no skill total, not a pvp world, not a high risk world, and doesn't care if you're in members or not.

* ### Planned list of plugins:
    * Tree chopper/burner
        * Currently pllaning to limit the implementation to Oaks around Ardougne Monestary/Ardougne Zoo
    * Ardougne Cake Stealer
        * Will support holding the X Marks The Spot lamp to prevent XP waste.
    * Wintertodt
        * Currently planning on only supporting fletch + burn, but maybe that'll change in the future.
    * Shilo Village Fisher
        * Will support fishing spots around the Shilo village and banking with the banker. No 3t support planned.
    * Threshold Teleporter (HCIM Tool)
        * Will support teleporting your character with a set item in your inventory if your HP falls below a certain threshold.
