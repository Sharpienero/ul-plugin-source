### Current finished list of plugins:

* #### Lumbridge Castle Burn and Hop
    * Start this plugin on the top level of Lumbridge castle between the four log spawn spot. Have a tinderbox in your inventory. The plugin will automatically burn the logs and then proceed to hop to a *normal* world, meaning no skill total, not a pvp world, not a high risk world, and doesn't care if you're in members or not.
